My Bachelor thesis and individual software project, TransportEditor.

TransportEditor aims to be a problem editor and plan visualizer for the Transport domain from the IPC 2008.
The goal is to create an intuitive GUI desktop application for making quick changes and re-planning,
but also designing a new problem dataset from scratch.

== Development documentation

=== Short design description

The model for the Transport domain is pretty complicated,
because it handles:

* Multiple variants of the Transport domain
* Planning and visualization with the same model

That's what this short section is for -- describing the ideas behind the model, so that reading the code
afterwards is easier.

The model is split into 4 parts:

* Session
* Domain
* Problem
* Plan

=== Plan

The plan consists of an ordered list of actions.
There are two types of plans:

* Sequential - these plans are strictly linear, actions do not overlap. (imagine simple linked list)
* Temporal - every action in this plan has a time interval in which it takes place.
This plan is basically a set of intervals with associated actions. For storing it, we use an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree[Interval tree], which allows efficient access to actions given a time or
time range.

===== Visualizing plans

There are currently two ways to visualize both plan types:

* Simple list -- both sequential and temporal versions look similar. Both are filterable by right clicking on the headers.
** Sequential: uses a simple drag-and-drop reorderable table of action arguments.
See the screenshot on the top of the README for a preview. Is redrawn completely after every change.
** Temporal: in contrast to the sequential variant, this one cannot be reordered by dragging. The start times can however
be edited, which will result in the table reordering itself. Is not redrawn completely, adjusts its internal state and
redraws the necessary parts.

* Gantt chart -- both sequential and temporal versions look alike, resembling a XY chart, the X axis being the time
axis and the Y axis having all action objects. Both are redrawn every time the plan changes or it's filter
in the simple list is changed.
** Sequential: using it to visualize sequential plans is quite non-interesting, as it offers almost no added insights
on top of the simple list
** Temporal: when visualizing temporal plans with a Gantt, we can observe the synchronicity of planned actions
and, to some extent, the cooperation of individual actors

//* "Graph"
//** Sequential: path with relationships to other tasks (precondition blockers) as edges
//** Temporal: graph (nodes sorted by time - find a visually pleasing way) with relationships to other tasks
//(precondition blockers) as edges

==== Persisting plans

Using string manipulation and built-in constants and format, it is persisted into a VAL-like format.
For parsing, we assume a correct and valid VAL-like plan. A very simple string manipulation and Regex-based approach
is used for both temporal and sequential plans. Additionally, a simple http://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR] grammar
is used in some places. See the `persistence` package for details.



=== Problem

The problem is basically a graph (with multiple possible "layers", f.e. fuel) and a vehicle and package map.

Currently we use http://graphstream-project.org/[GraphStream] for both the data storage and visualization of the graph.
Apart from nodes and edge arrows, everything else is visualized as
"link:http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/Graph-Visualisation/#sprites[sprites]".

Fuel is added as different graph edge type (FuelRoad instead of DefaultRoad) and a domain label change
(see `PddlLabel`s in the domain).
If the domain is fuel enabled, the fuel properties of locations, roads and vehicles else will be displayed.

===== Visualizing problems

Problem visualization does not fundamentally differ between different domains and problems.
Some problem tooltips/properties might dis/appear when changing the domain type.

The graph is automatically laid out using a `SpringBox` algorithm from GraphStream
for a given time and then switched to manual layout.

==== Persisting problems

Both rule pages of http://icaps-conference.org/ipc2008/deterministic/CompetitionRules.html[IPC-6]
and https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/rules.html[IPC-8]
specify PDDL 3.1 as their official modelling language (language for domain
and problem specification).
Daniel L. Kovacs proposed an updated and corrected BNF (Backus-Naur Form)
https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repository/kovacs-pddl-3.1-2011.pdf[definition of PDDL 3.1].

Using a http://freemarker.org/[Freemarker] template and a lot of string manipulation it is persisted into PDDL.
For parsing, we assume a correct and valid problem and use a formal grammar written in http://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR]
to parse PDDL into a generated code structure provided by ANTLR and the `maven-antlr-plugin`. The same grammar as for
domains is used. See the `persistence` package and the `src/main/antlr4` folder for details.




=== Domain

There is basically only one domain type: `VariableDomain` (we also have the notion of a `SequentialDomain`,
but it is basically just an in-code hardcoded equivalent of loading the sequential Transport domain PDDL
into a `VariableDomain`).

The domain contains flags (labels), telling us which "layers" are enabled and which are not.
The UI, validator, IO and planner all take these into account.
It also contains methods for action creation using their correct domain-specified definitions
and provides other useful data (predicates, functions, ...).

===== Visualizing domains

Domains are not visualizable per se.

==== Persisting domains

Using a http://freemarker.org/[Freemarker] template and a lot of string manipulation it is persisted into PDDL.
For parsing, we assume a correct and valid problem and use a formal grammar written in http://www.antlr.org/[ANTLR]
to parse PDDL into a generated code structure provided by ANTLR and the `maven-antlr-plugin`. The same grammar as for
problems is used.

TransportEditor doesn't load the PDDL domain definitions directly -- those are already built-in.
We only read the domain files to check which subset of conditions the user has chosen to model.

In the UI, we can also create a domain using a dialog backed by the `VariableDomainBuilder`.
It is essentially switchboard for gathering the appropriate flags and other properties the domain should have.



=== Session

The session is where everything comes together. It keeps an instance of the domain, problem and plan (and planner and
validator, ...). We can use it to reason about what actions can be executed in the UI with the currently loaded
objects and also as a quick persistence solution -- if you save a session, you can then load it next time and
do not have to open all the individual parts again.

===== Visualizing sessions

Sessions are visualized by visualizing all their (possible) parts.

==== Persisting sessions

Sessions are persisted automatically to XML using https://x-stream.github.io/[XStream]. This means, all its properties
should be reasonably serializable (by reflection).



=== Planning

Any class implementing the `Planner` interface can be set as the planner for a session and if it has all the properties
that are needed (domain & problem), we can generate a plan using an instance of that class. TransportEditor supports
external (executable) planners out of the box, given that the executable adhere to a few rules (for details, see
`ExternalPlanner`). An end of planning event is raised after planning finishes, for UI redrawing purposes.



=== Validation

Any class implementing the `Validator` interface can be used as a validator for plans in a planning session.
Validation happens automatically after planning in a session or it can be triggered manually. There are different
validators with different strictness (used for different domain variants). Choosing a wrong combination of domain,
problem and validator might cause false positives or false negatives, make sure to read the documentation of the
individual validators. TransportEditor supports a popular external validator called VAL, out of the box.



=== General notes

There are few other small features of the project worth mentioning.

==== CDI & the EventBus

CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) using http://weld.cdi-spec.org/[Weld] is used for inversion of control
and for communication without tight coupling. Should only be used in the UI part of the project.

For event-driven communication on the front end, Guava's `EventBus` is used. Again, it enables persistent
reactive handling without tight coupling.

==== JavaFX properties and bindings

The JavaFX based UI makes heavy use of bindings and properties, essential features of JavaFX. They enable
reactive changes to the UI in an efficient manner, but can be a bit tricky when reading code that uses them.
For even more power, we use the http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/[ControlsFX] library, but try to avoid it,
if possible.

==== Model immutability

The model (mainly the package `com.oskopek.transport.model`) is designed to be immutable
(excluding a few exceptions). This makes it easier to reason about complex, possibly multithreaded operations
on top of it. This note is useful to keep in mind when reading code that changes the model data.

==== Tests

The project aims to be well tested and verified. To stick to these goals, we have several levels of tests,
that are run by a CI (Continuous Integration) system after every push and should also be run by developers
(at least) after every commit. The displayed test coverage in the README is calculated as an average of unit
and integration test coverage.

TransportEditor currently has 3 types of tests:

* Unit tests (`*Test.java`) -- simple and quick to run tests that test one thing and test it well.
* Integration tests (`*IT.java`) -- complex tests that handle multiple moving parts at once. Usually involving IO or
other not easily mockable things. Try to avoid abusively writing these in favour of unit tests, if possible.
* User interface tests (`*UI.java`) -- test the UI using https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX].
Under-represented and run not very often. CI doesn't run them by default at the moment.

==== Comments, code style

TransportEditor employs a rigorous code style checker called `checkstyle` that is run automatically at every build.
Please adhere to that style when extending/editing the code base. Multiple other unwritten and unspecified rules might
apply. Please, do not take any style comments personally  -- they are in place so that the code remains in tact and
readable in the long term.

As part of the `checkstyle` process, JavaDoc comments are enforced on every method and class (excluding tests).
They should briefly describe the design/implementation choices, *why* they were made and any useful examples and or
other quirks.
